What is ScaleIT?
================

ScaleIT is a solution to bring advanced IT technologies to manufacturing companies. We bring the necessary **software and hardware infrastructure** to the manufacturing shop floor of small and medium companies and help people work better by introducing **modern Industrial Grade Apps**.

It is a work in progress created within the ScaleIT Project funded by the BMBF (Fkz.: 02P14B180ff).

There are three main components to the ScaleIT solution the ScaleIT Software Platform, ScaleIT Hardware and the ScaleIT Community, as seen in the figure below.

ScaleIT Software Platform
  In IT, a platform is any hardware or software used to host an application or service. An application platform, for example, consists of hardware, an operating system and coordinating programs that use the instruction set for a particular processor or microprocessor [#f1]_. 

  Have a deeper look at the software architecture :ref:`here <ScaleIT Architektur>`.
